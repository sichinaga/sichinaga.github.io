# Code

I am a <span style="color: #007bff;">Python expert</span> with extensive experience as a Python package developer, maintainer, and educator. See my [GitHub](https://github.com/sichinaga/) for a list of all of my projects.

Here are some cool Python projects that I've been working on recently:

## PyDMD: A Python Package for Dynamic Mode Decomposition

The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven algorithm that takes time-varying snapshot data sets and decomposes them into their dominant spatiotemporal components. [PyDMD](https://github.com/PyDMD/PyDMD) is a Python package that implements DMD and many of the algorithm's most notable variants. We recently revamped the package to include even more variants and features! Read about it in our [JMLR paper](http://jmlr.org/papers/v25/24-0739.html) and our [longer version on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07463). Try out the code on your own data set today!

## PyRidge: A Python Package for Dimension Reduction and Ridge Function Approximation
