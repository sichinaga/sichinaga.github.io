## Graduate Certificate in AI and ML for Engineering Program
I am currently a teaching assistant for the UW College of Engineering [Graduate Certificate in AI and ML for Engineering Program](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/professional-masters-certificates/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-certificate).

- **ENGR 515: Data-Driven Optimization** (Teaching Assistant, Winter 2025)
_Applied optimization is the backbone of modern data-driven modeling and machine learning. This course covers optimization techniques used across modern engineering, including in machine learning and control theory. This course covers both optimization fundamentals and deep-dives into relevant topics, such as convex vs. nonconvex optimization, constrained optimization, high-dimensional and stochastic techniques for big data, and computational techniques._

- **ENGR 510: Foundations of Machine Learning for Engineering** (Teaching Assistant, Fall 2024)
_The first course in the certificate builds foundational skills for using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in engineering. This includes mathematical and coding skills, an introduction to types of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, and an overview of how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be applied to engineering applications. Also includes a brief introduction to ethics in AI._
