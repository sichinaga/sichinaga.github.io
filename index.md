# Welcome to my page!

Hello! My name is Sara Ichinaga and I am an Applied Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington studying under Professors J. Nathan Kutz and Steven L. Brunton. My research generally deals with data-driven modeling and machine learning methods. In particular, I am interested in developing and improving methods that can be used to model complex system dynamics solely from real-world, time-varying snapshot data.

# Highlights
Here are some things that I've been working on recently!

## PyDMD: a Python package for dynamic mode decomposition
The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven algorithm that takes time-varying snapshot data sets and decomposes them into their dominant spatiotemporal components. PyDMD is a Python package that implements DMD and many of the algorithm's notable variants. We also recently revamped the package to include even more variants and features! Read about it in our [JMLR paper](http://jmlr.org/papers/v25/24-0739.html) and our longer [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07463), or try out the code on your own data set today! [https://github.com/PyDMD/PyDMD](https://github.com/PyDMD/PyDMD)

## mrCOSTS: a method for discovering spatiotemporal components in multi-scale data
The multi-resolution Coherent Spatio-Temporal Scale Separation (mrCOSTS) algorithm is a methodological extension of the DMD algorithm that consolidates the results of multiple DMD fits that are taken over sliding windows of data across various window sizes. The resulting algorithm is hence capable of decomposing noisy real-world multi-scale data sets. This work has recently been accepted by PNAS! Yay! The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02396).

## Teaching for the Graduate Certificate in AI and ML for Engineering program
I am currently serving as the (very first!) teaching assistant for ENGR 515 (Data-Driven Optimization), which is a part of the new UW Graduate Certificate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Engineering program [[link]](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/professional-masters-certificates/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-certificate). I additionally served as the teaching assistant for ENGR 510 (Foundations of Machine Learning for Engineering) in Fall 2024.
